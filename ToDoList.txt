*** FUTURE FEATURES (TO BE IMPLEMENTED) ***
1. Better input files: The user can put the variables in any order, just by declaring it by name. Example dim=3, nRMS=2
2. Put a customcalc before integrator to contemplate customvalues initial conditions
3. Finish the general dynamical systems toolbox (Lorenz, Lotk-Volterra, Halvorsen, Rossler, etc) - Add missing modules and change timestep to be defined by the user, not by number of divisions
4. Make a Simplified Version of the Forced Basin of Attraction based only on poincare map, without lyapunov.
5. Implement different integrators like Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) Method for nonsmooth systems, Symplectic integrators for hamiltonian systems, Variational integrators for euler-lagrangian systems, etc.. to be attached with the existing modules, letting the users decide which integrator they want to use.
6. Implement Lyapunov Exponents Cloned Dynamics method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
7. Implement 0-1 Test for Chaos method and integrate with existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
8. Implement Geometric Poincar√© Map for systems that don't have harmonic external forcing terms.
9. Implement Lyapunov Dimension (Kaplan-Yorke Dimension) and Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy
10. Implement Harmonic Balance Method to find all solution branches of a parameter domain.


*** KNOWN ISSUES AND POSSIBLE BUGS ***
1. Bug in progress bar in dyndiag (showing two %%) and bifurcation (when starting from a advance number, it bugs in 100% always)
