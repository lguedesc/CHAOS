1. Make a module to general dynamical systems (Lorenz, Lotk-Volterra, Halvorsen, Rossler, etc)
2. Make a Simplified Version of the Dynamical Diagram based only on poincare map, without lyapunov.
3. Make a Simplified Version of the Forced Basin of Attraction based only on poincare map, without lyapunov.
4. Implement Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) Method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which integrator he/she wants to use.
5. Implement Lyapunov Exponents Cloned Dynamics method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
6. Implement 0-1 Test for Chaos method and integrate with existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
