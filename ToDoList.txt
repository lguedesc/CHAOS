1. Make a module to general dynamical systems (Lorenz, Lotk-Volterra, Halvorsen, Rossler, etc)
2. Make a Simplified Version of the Forced Basin of Attraction based only on poincare map, without lyapunov.
3. Implement Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) Method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which integrator he/she wants to use.
4. Implement Lyapunov Exponents Cloned Dynamics method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
5. Implement 0-1 Test for Chaos method and integrate with existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
6. Implement Geometric Poincaré Map for systems that don't have harmonic external forcing terms.
7. Implement Lyapunov Dimension (Kaplan-Yorke Dimension) and Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy
8. Implement Multiple Scales Method to find all solution branches of a parameter domain.
