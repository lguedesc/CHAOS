*** FUTURE FEATURES (TO BE IMPLEMENTED) ***
1. Finish the general dynamical systems toolbox (Lorenz, Lotk-Volterra, Halvorsen, Rossler, etc) - Add missing modules and change timestep to be defined by the user, not by number of divisions
2. Make a Simplified Version of the Forced Basin of Attraction based only on poincare map, without lyapunov.
3. Implement Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) Method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which integrator he/she wants to use.
4. Implement Lyapunov Exponents Cloned Dynamics method and integrate with the existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
5. Implement 0-1 Test for Chaos method and integrate with existing modules, letting the user decide which method he/she wants to use.
6. Implement Geometric Poincar√© Map for systems that don't have harmonic external forcing terms.
7. Implement Lyapunov Dimension (Kaplan-Yorke Dimension) and Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy
8. Implement Harmonic Balance Method to find all solution branches of a parameter domain.

*** URGENT!!! ***
1. Change bifmode to be inserted on top of input file for all bifurcation/dynamical diagram modules
3. Eficiencia media de entrada

*** KNOWN ISSUES AND POSSIBLE BUGS ***
2. See if f is really necessary in rk4 arguments.
